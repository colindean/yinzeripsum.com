This is silly website for generating filler text 'n'at.
It uses [fillertext](https://github.com/colindean/fillertext) as a backend.

This was an October 2012 [Code & Supply Build Night](https://codeandsupply.co)
(ne√© OpenHack) project that's been ~dormant since inception.
It was returned to active service when I remembered it while cleaning out my
Heroku account ahead of its retirement of free hosting.
